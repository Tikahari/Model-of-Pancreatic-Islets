The pancreas plays a vital role in the regulation of blood glucose, metabolism, and digestion. Endocrine cells of the pancreas, which secrete the major hormones responsible for glucose regulation, exhibit characteristic electrophysiological excitability similar to what is observed in neurons. This electrical excitability and the relevant metabolic pathways involved can be considered thermodynamic processes and subsequently mathematically modeled according to the temporal dynamics of relevant ion channels and the enthalpies of the corresponding reactants and products. Such a mathematical model can yield information otherwise impossible to discern in vivo and facilitate greater efficacy of drug and treatment development. In this thesis, we seek to develop an ensemble model of endocrine cells of the pancreas parameterized through a single-objective evolutionary algorithm.
