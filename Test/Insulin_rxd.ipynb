    "Throughout the first interation of this notebook I learned that if you have more than one extracellular space that things initialize improperly. This can be replicated by creating one extracellular space and running a simulation and then when you create the next and add a species, the initial concentrations in the `states3d` matrix will be zeros regardless of the initial value you input but you will get the right initial value when checking `species.initial` as `initial` is a property of the species and `states3d` is an object of the extracellular space. I thought this was because at first the coordinates of my extracellular spaces were identical meaning if they exist is some more abstract space in the background of NEURON, that they are overlapping. So I tried to create a second space with different coordinates and this was still the case. When instead of creating a second space I created a new species in the same space (Ins_2_test_const_rate_same_ecs) and the results were as they should be despite the initialization being different. The issue might have something to do with files that are created when a reaction-diffusion simulation is ran (name e.g., \"rxddllb77c608a-f973-11eb-8286-c858c0244ed2.so\"). Two were created when I ran a simulation with a singular extracellular space. I ran another identical simulation and two more were created and the results were the same (Insulin_test_const_rate and Insulin_test_const_rate_2). \n",

    "\n",
    "To test this I will first run a simulation using the `ik` range variable in the steady_k mechanism. This worked as expected, I used a initial concentration of 100 and it increased to 2100 over the 2000 ms. I added a line of code that outputs the max and min concentrations during the simulations in the central voxel where the section is.\n",

    "Sometimes the integrator will run into issues when using very small values. JIS initially is 9.608596975100945e-09. NEURON recommends using variable time step integration to deal with this but we haven't been able to successfully use it with our one mechanism. The steady_k will be a good test case since there is no derivative block. Therefore if we use the variable time step here it will effect solely the rxd rate equation and not interact with the mod file. First I will try running a simulation with a small value without variable-step enabled and then I will try it with if I see errors. \n",

The values shown in the plot are to the negative 8th power and appear to match the data. The scientific notation on the border of the plots appears to be a shift. In the figure it says 1e-8+4.8042984e1 which means the values shown are shifted by 48.042984. In the simulation with the one mechanism and no rxd, we saw a constant decrease to below 48 in a 2000 simulation.
