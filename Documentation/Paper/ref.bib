	abstract = {Electrical activity plays a pivotal role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic b-cells. Recent findings have shown that the electrophysiological characteristics of human b-cells differ from their rodent counterparts. We show that the electrophysiological responses in human b-cells to a range of ion channels antagonists are heterogeneous. In some cells, inhibition of small-conductance potassium currents has no effect on action potential firing, while it increases the firing frequency dramatically in other cells. Sodium channel block can sometimes reduce action potential amplitude, sometimes abolish electrical activity, and in some cells even change spiking electrical activity to rapid bursting. We show that, in contrast to L-type Ca2z -channels, P/Q-type Ca2z -currents are not necessary for action potential generation, and, surprisingly, a P/Q-type Ca2z -channel antagonist even accelerates action potential firing. By including SK-channels and Ca2z dynamics in a previous mathematical model of electrical activity in human b-cells, we investigate the heterogeneous and nonintuitive electrophysiological responses to ion channel antagonists, and use our findings to obtain insight in previously published insulin secretion measurements. Using our model we also study paracrine signals, and simulate slow oscillations by adding a glycolytic oscillatory component to the electrophysiological model. The heterogenous electrophysiological responses in human b-cells must be taken into account for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying insulin secretion in health and disease, and as shown here, the interdisciplinary combination of experiments and modeling increases our understanding of human b-cell physiology.},

Despite years of research, however, the mechanism of glucagon secretion in a-cells is still not well established. It has been proposed that glucose regulates glucagon secretion by decreasing the conductance of either outward ATP-dependent potassium channels (K(ATP)) or an inward store-operated current (SOC). We have developed a mathematical model based on mouse data to test these hypotheses and found that both mechanisms are possible. Glucose metabolism closes K(ATP) channels, which depolarizes the cell but paradoxically reduces calcium inﬂux by inactivating voltage-dependent calcium and sodium channels and decreases secretion. Glucose metabolism also activates SERCA pumps, which ﬁlls the endoplasmic reticulum and hyperpolarizes the cells by reducing the inward current through SOC channels and again suppresses glucagon secretion. We ﬁnd further that the two mechanisms can combine to account for the nonmonotonic dependence of secretion on glucose observed in some studies, an effect that cannot be obtained with either mechanism alone.},

	abstract = {The regulation of glucagon secretion in the pancreatic α-cell is not well understood. It has been proposed that glucose suppresses glucagon secretion either directly through an intrinsic mechanism within the α-cell or indirectly through an extrinsic mechanism. Previously, we described a mathematical model for isolated pancreatic α-cells and used it to investigate possible intrinsic mechanisms of regulating glucagon secretion. We demonstrated that glucose can suppress glucagon secretion through both ATP-dependent potassium channels (K
              ATP
              ) and a store-operated current (SOC). We have now developed an islet model that combines previously published mathematical models of α- and β-cells with a new model of δ-cells and use it to explore the effects of insulin and somatostatin on glucagon secretion. We show that the model can reproduce experimental observations that the inhibitory effect of glucose remains even when paracrine modulators are no longer acting on the α-cell. We demonstrate how paracrine interactions can either synchronize α- and δ-cells to produce pulsatile oscillations in glucagon and somatostatin secretion or fail to do so. The model can also account for the paradoxical observation that glucagon can be out of phase with insulin, whereas α-cell calcium is in phase with insulin. We conclude that both paracrine interactions and the α-cell's intrinsic mechanisms are needed to explain the response of glucagon secretion to glucose.},

The β cell is electrically excitable; in response to an elevation of glucose, it depolarizes and starts generating action potentials. The electrophysiology of mouse β cells and the cell’s role in insulin secretion have been extensively investigated. More recently, similar studies have been performed on human β cells. These studies have revealed numerous and important differences between human and rodent β cells. Here we discuss the properties of human pancreatic β cells: their glucose sensing, the ion channel complement underlying glucose-induced electrical activity that culminates in exocytotic release of insulin, the cellular control of exocytosis, and the modulation of insulin secretion by circulating hormones and locally released neurotransmitters. Finally, we consider the pathophysiology of insulin secretion and the interactions between genetics and environmental factors that may explain the current diabetes epidemic.},

A large number of neurotransmitters and their receptors has been identiﬁed in the islet, but relatively little is known about their involvement in islet biology. Interestingly, neurotransmitters initially thought to be present in autonomic axons innervating the islet are also present in endocrine cells of the human islet. These neurotransmitters can thus be released as paracrine signals to help control hormone release. Here we propose that the role of neurotransmitters may extend beyond controlling endocrine cell function to work as signals modulating vascular ﬂow and immune responses within the islet.},

	abstract = {The pancreatic islet secretes the hormones insulin and glucagon to regulate glucose metabolism. To generate an adequate secretory response, islet endocrine cells must receive multiple regulatory signals relaying information about changes in the internal and external environments. Islet cells also need to be made aware about the functional status of neighboring cells through paracrine interactions. All this information is used to orchestrate a hormonal response that contributes to glucose homeostasis. Several neurotransmitters have been proposed to work as paracrine signals in the islet. Most of these, however, have yet to meet the criteria to be considered bona ﬁde paracrine signals, in particular in human islets. Here, we review recent ﬁndings describing autocrine and paracrine signaling mechanisms in human islets. These recent results are showing an increasingly complex picture of paracrine interactions in the human islet and emphasize that results from other species cannot be readily extrapolated to the human context. Investigators are unveiling new signaling mechanisms or ﬁnding new roles for known paracrine signals in human islets. While it is too early to provide a synthesis, the ﬁeld of islet research is deﬁning the paracrine and autocrine components that will be used to generate models about how islet function is regulated. Meanwhile, the identiﬁed signaling pathways can be proposed as therapeutic targets for treating diabetes, a devastating disease affecting millions worldwide.},

	abstract = {Coordinated insulin secretion is controlled by electrical coupling of pancreatic β-cells due to connexin-36 gap junctions. Gap junction coupling not only synchronizes the heterogeneous β-cell population, but can also modify the electrical behavior of the cells. These phenomena have been widely studied with mathematical models based on data from mouse β-cells. However, it is now known that human β-cell electrophysiology shows important differences to its rodent counterpart, and although human pancreatic islets express connexin-36 and show evidence of β-cell coupling, these aspects have been little investigated in human β-cells. Here we investigate theoretically, the gap junction coupling strength required for synchronizing electrical activity in a small cluster of cells simulated with a recent mathematical model of human β-cell electrophysiology. We ﬁnd a lower limit for the coupling strength of approximately 20 pS (i.e., normalized to cell size, ∼2 pS pF−1) below which spiking electrical activity is asynchronous. To confront this theoretical lower bound with data, we use our model to estimate from an experimental patch clamp recording that the coupling strength is approximately 100–200 pS (10–20 pS pF−1), similar to previous estimates in mouse β-cells. We then investigate the role of gap junction coupling in synchronizing and modifying other forms of electrical activity in human β-cell clusters. We ﬁnd that electrical coupling can prolong the period of rapid bursting electrical activity, and synchronize metabolically driven slow bursting, in particular when the metabolic oscillators are in phase. Our results show that realistic coupling conductances are sufﬁcient to promote synchrony in small clusters of human β-cells as observed experimentally, and provide motivation for further detailed studies of electrical coupling in human pancreatic islets.},

The currently most accurate method for determining ion channel kinetic mechanisms is single-channel recording and analysis. Yet, the limitations and complexities in interpreting single-channel recordings discourage many physiologists from using them. Here we show that a genetic search algorithm in combination with a gradient descent algorithm can be used to fit whole-cell voltage-clamp data to kinetic models with a high degree of accuracy. Previously, ion channel stimulation traces were analyzed one at a time, the results of these analyses being combined to produce a picture of channel kinetics. Here the entire set of traces from all stimulation protocols are analysed simultaneously. The algorithm was initially tested on simulated current traces produced by several Hodgkin-Huxley–like and Markov chain models of voltage-gated potassium and sodium channels. Currents were also produced by simulating levels of noise expected from actual patch recordings. Finally, the algorithm was used for finding the kinetic parameters of several voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels models by matching its results to data recorded from layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the rat cortex in the nucleated outside-out patch configuration. The minimization scheme gives electrophysiologists a tool for reproducing and simulating voltage-gated ion channel kinetics at the cellular level.},

We used a large dataset of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from cells in intact mouse islets (N = 288 recordings) to investigate whether it is possible to reliably identify cell type (α, β or δ) based on their electrophysiological characteristics. We quantified 15 electrophysiological variables in each recorded cell. Individually, none of the variables could reliably distinguish the cell types. We therefore constructed a logistic regression model that included all quantified variables, to determine whether they could together identify cell type. The model identified cell type with 94\% accuracy. This model was applied to a dataset of cells recorded from hyperglycaemic βV59M mice; it correctly identified cell type in all cells and was able to distinguish cells that co-expressed insulin and glucagon. Based on this revised functional identification, we were able to improve conductance-based models of the electrical activity in α-cells and generate a model of δ-cell electrical activity. These new models could faithfully emulate α- and δ-cell electrical activity recorded experimentally.},

	abstract = {Background:
Digestive enzymes are able to break down proteins and carbohydrates and lipids, and their
supplementation may play a role in the management of digestive disorders, from lactose intolerance to cystic fibrosis.
To date, several formulations of digestive enzymes are available on the market, being different each other in
terms of enzyme type, source and origin, and dosage.

Methods:
This review, performed through a non-systematic search of the available literature, will provide an overview of the current knowledge of digestive enzyme supplementation in gastrointestinal disorders, discussion of the use of pancreatic enzymes, lactase (β-galactosidase) and conjugated bile acids, and also exploring the future perspective of digestive enzyme supplementation.

Results:
Currently, the animal-derived enzymes represent an established standard of care, however the growing study of plant-based and microbe-derived enzymes offers great promise in the advancement of digestive enzyme therapy.

Conclusion:
New frontiers of enzyme replacement are being evaluated also in the treatment of diseases not specifically related to enzyme deficiency, whereas the combination of different enzymes might constitute an intriguing therapeutic option in the future.},

Recent reports on large animals, including humans, show a difference in islet architecture, in which the endocrine cells are randomly distributed throughout the islet. This particular species difference has raised concerns regarding the interpretation of data based on rodent studies to humans. On the other hand, further variations have been reported in marsupials and some nonhuman primates, which possess an inverted ratio of β-cells to other endocrine cells. This review discusses the striking plasticity of islet architecture and cellular composition among various species including changes in response to metabolic states within a single species.

	abstract = {Pancreatic islets are complex micro-organs consisting of at least three different cell types: glucagon-secreting alpha, insulin-producing beta and somatostatin-releasing delta cells1. Somatostatin is a powerful paracrine inhibitor of insulin and glucagon secretion2. In diabetes, increased somatostatinergic signalling leads to defective counter-regulatory glucagon secretion3. This increases the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, a dangerous complication of insulin therapy4. The regulation of somatostatin secretion involves both intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms5 but their relative contributions and whether they interact remain unclear. Here we show that dapagliflozin-sensitive glucose- and insulin-dependent sodium uptake stimulates somatostatin secretion by elevating the cytoplasmic Na+ concentration (intracellular [Na+]; [Na+]i) and promoting intracellular Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. This mechanism also becomes activated when [Na+]i is elevated following the inhibition of the plasmalemmal Na+-K+ pump by reductions of the extracellular K+ concentration emulating those produced by exogenous insulin in vivo6. Islets from some donors with type-2 diabetes hypersecrete somatostatin, leading to suppression of glucagon secretion that can be alleviated by a somatostatin receptor antagonist. Our data highlight the role of Na+ as an intracellular second messenger, illustrate the significance of the intra-islet paracrine network and provide a mechanistic framework for pharmacological correction of the hormone secretion defects associated with diabetes that selectively target the delta cells.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review
The biology of the pancreas is exquisitely complex and involves both endocrine and exocrine functions that are regulated by an integrated array of neural and hormonal processes. This review discusses recent developments in the regulation of both endocrine and exocrine secretion from the pancreas.

Recent Findings
New data suggest that cholecystokinin can stimulate neurons located in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Addressing a controversial topic, recent evidence suggests a direct secretory action of CCK on human acinar cells. An emerging concept is that some hormones and peptides such as melatonin, ghrelin, obestatin and leptin perform dual functions in the pancreas by regulating secretion and maintaining metabolic homeostasis. The regulation of pancreatic secretion by several appetite-controlling neuropeptides such as ghrelin, orexin A, NPY, is also discussed. Recent data highlight findings that mechanisms of hormone action may be different between species possibly due to a divergence in signaling pathways during evolution.

Summary
The regulation of the secretory function of the pancreas by numerous hormones suggests that there are multiple and perhaps redundant signals governing the control of this important organ. Understanding these diverse pathways is essential to the treatment of pancreatitis, diabetes and obesity.},

	abstract = {The control of food intake and body weight by the brain relies upon the detection and integration of signals reflecting energy stores and fluxes, and their interaction with many different inputs related to food palatability and gastrointestinal handling as well as social, emotional, circadian, habitual and other situational factors. This review focuses upon the role of hormones secreted by the endocrine pancreas: hormones, which individually and collectively influence food intake, with an emphasis upon insulin, glucagon and amylin. Insulin and amylin are co-secreted by B-cells and provide a signal that reflects both circulating energy in the form of glucose and stored energy in the form of visceral adipose tissue. Insulin acts directly at the liver to suppress the synthesis and secretion of glucose, and some plasma insulin is transported into the brain and especially the mediobasal hypothalamus where it elicits a net catabolic response, particularly reduced food intake and loss of body weight. Amylin reduces meal size by stimulating neurons in the hindbrain, and there is evidence that amylin additionally functions as an adiposity signal controlling body weight as well as meal size. Glucagon is secreted from A-cells and increases glucose secretion from the liver. Glucagon acts in the liver to reduce meal size, the signal being relayed to the brain via the vagus nerves. To summarize, hormones of the endocrine pancreas are collectively at the crossroads of many aspects of energy homeostasis. Glucagon and amylin act in the short term to reduce meal size, and insulin sensitizes the brain to short-term meal-generated satiety signals; and insulin and perhaps amylin as well act over longer intervals to modulate the amount of fat maintained and defended by the brain. Hormones of the endocrine pancreas interact with receptors at many points along the gut–brain axis, from the liver to the sensory vagus nerve to the hindbrain to the hypothalamus; and their signals are conveyed both neurally and humorally. Finally, their actions include gastrointestinal and metabolic as well as behavioural effects.},

	abstract = {Acinar and ductal cells of the exocrine pancreas form a close functional unit. Although most studies contain data either on acinar or ductal cells, an increasing number of evidence highlights the importance of the pancreatic acinar-ductal functional unit. One of the best examples for this functional unit is the regulation of luminal pH by both cell types. Protons co-released during exocytosis from acini cause significant acidosis, whereas, bicarbonate secreted by ductal cells cause alkalization in the lumen. This suggests that the first and probably one of the most important role of bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic ductal cells is not only to neutralize the acid chyme entering into the duodenum from the stomach, but to neutralize acidic content secreted by acinar cells. To accomplish this role, it is more than likely that ductal cells have physiological sensing mechanisms which would allow them to regulate luminal pH. To date, four different classes of acid-sensing ion channels have been identified in the gastrointestinal tract (transient receptor potential ion channels, two-pore domain potassium channel, ionotropic purinoceptor and acid-sensing ion channel), however, none of these have been studied in pancreatic ductal cells. In this mini-review, we summarize our current knowledge of these channels and urge scientists to characterize ductal acid-sensing mechanisms and also to investigate the challenge of the acinar acid load on ductal cells.},

The 2-year overall survival (OS) was better for the head than for the B/T PDACs (44 vs. 27\%, p = 0.043), especially when comparing tumors with similar TNM classification (T3/4N0M0: 67\% vs. 17\%, p = 0.002) or from the same molecular class (squamous subtype: 31\% vs. 0\%, p {\textless} 0.0001). Bailey’s molecular subtypes were differentially distributed within the two groups, with the immunogenic subtype being underrepresented in the “B/T” group (p = 0.005). Uni- and multivariate analyses indicated that PDAC anatomic location was an independent prognostic factor. Finally, the supervised analysis identified 334 genes differentially expressed. Genes upregulated in the “head” group suggested lymphocyte activation and pancreas exocrine functions. Genes upregulated in the “B/T” group were related to keratinocyte differentiation, in line with the enrichment for squamous phenotype. We identified a robust gene expression signature (GES) associated with B/T PDAC location, suggesting that head and B/T PDAC are different. This GES could serve as an indicator for differential therapeutic management based on PDAC location.},

	abstract = {The coordinated regulation between cellular glucose uptake and endogenous glucose production is indispensable for the maintenance of constant blood glucose concentrations. The liver contributes significantly to this process by altering the levels of hepatic glucose release, through controlling the processes of de novo glucose production (gluconeogenesis) and glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis). Various nutritional and hormonal stimuli signal to alter hepatic gluconeogenic flux, and suppression of this metabolic pathway during the postprandial state can, to a significant extent, be attributed to insulin. Here, we review some of the molecular mechanisms through which insulin modulates hepatic gluconeogenesis, thus controlling glucose production by the liver to ultimately maintain normoglycemia. Various signaling pathways governed by insulin converge at the level of transcriptional regulation of the key hepatic gluconeogenic genes PCK1 and G6PC, highlighting this as one of the focal mechanisms through which gluconeogenesis is modulated. In individuals with compromised insulin signaling, such as insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes, insulin fails to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis, even in the fed state; hence, an insight into these insulin-moderated pathways is critical for therapeutic purposes.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic endocrine cells expressing the ghrelin gene and producing the ghrelin hormone were first identified in 2002. These cells, named \&epsilon; cells, were recognized as the fifth type of endocrine cells. Differentiation of \&epsilon; cells is induced by various transcription factors, including Nk2 homeobox 2, paired box proteins Pax-4 and Pax6, and the aristaless-related homeobox. Ghrelin is generally considered to be a \&ldquo;hunger hormone\&rdquo; that stimulates the appetite and is produced mainly by the stomach. Although the population of \&epsilon; cells is small in adults, they play important roles in regulating other endocrine cells, especially \&beta; cells, by releasing ghrelin. However, the roles of ghrelin in \&beta; cells are complex. Ghrelin contributes to increased blood glucose levels by suppressing insulin release from \&beta; cells and is also involved in the growth and proliferation of \&beta; cells and the prevention of \&beta; cell apoptosis. Despite increasing evidence and clarification of the mechanisms of \&epsilon; cells over the last 20 years, many questions remain to be answered. In this review, we present the current evidence for the participation of \&epsilon; cells in differentiation and clarify their characteristics by focusing on the roles of ghrelin.},

Although its real-world relevance was long debated, a number of compelling examples have gradually alleviated much of the skepticism surrounding the model. The RD model can generate a wide variety of spatial patterns, and mathematical studies have revealed the kinds of interactions required for each, giving this model the potential for application as an experimental working hypothesis in a wide variety of morphological phenomena. In this review, we describe the essence of this theory for experimental biologists unfamiliar with the model, using examples from experimental studies in which the RD model is effectively incorporated.},

(In Biochemistry Biophysics of the Pancreatic-beta-Cell, George Thieme Verlag, New York, 100-107), we have formulated a mathematical model for ionic and electrical events that take place in pancreatic-beta-cells. Our formulation incorporates a Hodgkin-Huxley type gating mechanism for Ca2+ and K+ channels, in addition to Ca2+ gated K+-channels. Consistent with the experimental observations, our model generates spikes and bursts in beta-cell membrane potentials and gives the correct responses to additions of glucose, quinine, and tetraethylammonium ions. The response of the oscillations to ouabain and changing concentrations of external K+ can be incorporated into the present model, although a more complete treatment would require inclusion of the Na+/K+ pump.},

	abstract = {Neural circuits are initially redundant but rearranged through activity-dependent synapse elimination during postnatal development. This process is crucial for shaping mature neural circuits and for proper brain function. At birth, Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellum are innervated by multiple climbing fibers (CFs) with similar synaptic strengths. During postnatal development, a single CF is selectively strengthened in each PC through synaptic competition, the strengthened single CF undergoes translocation to a PC dendrite, and massive elimination of redundant CF synapses follows. To investigate the cellular mechanisms of this activity-dependent synaptic refinement, we generated mice with PC-selective deletion of the Ca(v)2.1 P/Q-type Ca(2+) channel, the major voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel in PCs. In the PC-selective Ca(v)2.1 knockout mice, Ca(2+) transients induced by spontaneous CF inputs are markedly reduced in PCs in vivo. Not a single but multiple CFs were equally strengthened in each PC from postnatal day 5 (P5) to P8, multiple CFs underwent translocation to PC dendrites, and subsequent synapse elimination until around P12 was severely impaired. Thus, P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels in postsynaptic PCs mediate synaptic competition among multiple CFs and trigger synapse elimination in developing cerebellum.},
