Goal: 
	- model secretion/diffusion of glucagon, insulin, somatostatin
Major problems: 
	1. nmodl and rxd variables do not match
	2. NaN present when Sherman model transcribed/run
	3. Major time series (voltage, currents, secretion) stabilize instead of periodically change/secrete
		- no 'spike' in any cells
		- 'spiking' no continous
		- hormonal secretion not correct
	
Possible solutions (1):
	- set secretion rate equal to ssto'
	- record nmodl and rxd variables during same run and compare
	- set rrate/urate to some value that changes according to secretion rate (JSS) in mod file
	- change isst such that the concentration of ssti and ssto change according to the secretion rate given by the mechanism
	
Important observations (1):
	- when ssti' set to 9999, ssti did not increase once it reached 2500
		- rxd version of ssti (sst_cyt) remained unchanged
	- when ssto' set to -9999, the slope of the ssto time series increased, but remained linear
		- rxd version of ssto (sst_cyt) remained unchanged
	- when ssto' and ssti' interchanged, the above patterns remained
	- charge, region, name of ion in rxd and mod match
	- writing ssti, ssto in breakpoint blocks did not change rxd curves, but did change mod curves as expected
	- making the only section a delta cell and the only hormone somatostatin did not change rxd curves
	- changing urate DID change rxd curve
	- when ssti, ssto, isst read only in mod file:
		- ssti matched rxd curve
		- ssto was very high then decreased (not sure whether matched or not)
		- isst was 0
	- when only isst written:
		- sstout and sst_ecs increased, sstin, sst_cyt unchanged when positive
		- sstout, sst_ecs, sstin, and sst_cyt changed when negative (sstin, sst_cyt matched)
	- when only ssti written:
		- only ssti changes
	- when isst written without write permission (tried as paramter and assigned)
		- isst changes, but ssti, sstout, sst_cyt, and sst_ecs remain unchanged
	* changing isst can have desired effect
	- when isst is set to -29, ssti/sst_cyt increase and ssto/sst_ecs decrease
		- this number changed when rrate and urate were changed
	- when isst is set to 0, ssti/sst_cyt/ssto/sst_ecs remain the same value throughout
	- when rrate and urate set equal to one another, setting isst to positive or negative creates the correct change in the direction of the flow of sst
	* no need for production when isst is changed	
	
Possible solutions (2):
	- dividing by tau component in h/mcapd equations may cause NaN
	
Important observations (2):
	- all 'small' variables not equal to 0 (not sure if calculated as 0)
	- y has a value for each time step (looks different than the equation mentioned in the paper)
	- when JSS and som set to 4, NaN still present in mcapqd and hcapqd but not in Sst
	- CaPQ current equal to that written by appropriate mod file
	- infd-state works for one more time step than (infd-state)/tau
		- dividing by tau in that time step (first) may cause m/hcapqd to go to NaN
	- glucagon/insulin/somatostatin are read correctly when declared as parameters but not when they are declared as assigned
	
	
Possible solutions (3):
	- Transcribed incorrectly/edited after correct transcription
		- vc term removed from G' equation
	- Capacitance set to wrong value

Important observations (3):
	- NRa curve changes in alpha cell
	- G flatlines after initial value
	- when current clamp of .1 nA added for 1 ms with 8ms delay, spike in membrane potential occured 
		- no spike in secretion
		- spiking is not continuous
	- when the cyptoplasmic concentration of insulin mutliplied by 100000
		- no change
	- when cyptoplasmic concentration of somatostatin multiplied by 100000
		- no change
	- when katp conductance multiplied by 999
		- membrane potential stabilizes to ekatp (-75)
	- changing values in heading of Watts xpp did not produce spiking
	- a.) when all conductances of ion channels with negative reversal potentials multiplied by .001
		- one initial spike occured
	- when previous + all conductances of ion channels with positive reversal potentials set to 700
		- initial spike + higher resting membrane potential
	- when hna_inf and mna_inf mutliplied by 999 + (cond mult .001)
		- higher resting membrane potential
	- b.) when tau of hna, mna in derivative states multiplied by .001 + (cond mult .001)
		- darker time series
	- when a.cm set to 0.001 + a + b
		- SPIKING
	- when a.cm small (.00000000000001), tau variables multiplied by .001, and gNa mutliplied by 100
		- multiple spikes close together at beginning, then stable
			- similar to beta cell activity
		- mna goes to 0, hna stabilizes
	- capacitance in microfarads
	- very different behavior when tau term is multiplied by different values
	- when gna set to 1100, taus multiplied by 0.01, spiking looks good
	- decreasing a.cm does not change spiking when gna and taus are set to above values
	- when i's commented out, SOLVE states moved to end of breakpoint block
		- no change
	- c.) when initial membrane potential changed
		- one initial spike
	- when c.) + capacitance changed
		- when capacitance decreased, larger initial spike, then no change

Major breakthroughs:
	- isoca current was not taken into account in the main membrane potential equation
	- spikes occured when conductance and time constant of sodium channel changed
	- when all equations put in 1 mod file, figures can be replicated
	
Next Steps:
	- use NEURON's current equations to calculate voltage
	- break apart mod files 
	- simulate with rxd
	- replace beta cell with Fridlyand model
	- clean
		- check units
		- comment
		- take away ugly
	- DONE
